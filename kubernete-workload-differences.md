| Purpose          | Ensures a specified number of Pod replicas are running at all times. | A more advanced version of ReplicationController, provides additional features and selectors. | Manages the deployment and scaling of Pods, provides declarative updates to Pods. | Manages the deployment and scaling of stateful applications. Provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of Pods. | Ensures that a copy of a Pod runs on each node in the cluster. |
| Pod Restart      | Does not support graceful termination and rolling updates. | Supports graceful termination and rolling updates. | Supports rolling updates, rollback, and versioning. | Supports rolling updates with ordered Pod creation and deletion. | Supports rolling updates and automatic node assignment. |
| Scaling          | Only supports scaling based on the number of replicas. | Supports scaling based on labels and selectors. | Supports scaling based on declared strategies (e.g., RollingUpdate, Recreate). | Supports scaling based on defined replicas and ordinal indexes. | Scales to exactly one Pod per node in the cluster. |
| Pod Identity     | Pods are considered interchangeable. | Pods are considered interchangeable. | Pods are considered interchangeable. | Each Pod has a stable, unique identifier. | Each Pod has a stable, unique identifier. |
| State Management | Does not manage stateful applications. | Does not manage stateful applications. | Does not manage stateful applications. | Specifically designed for managing stateful applications with unique identities. | Does not manage stateful applications. |
| Ordering         | No guarantee of the order of Pod creation or deletion. | No guarantee of the order of Pod creation or deletion. | No guarantee of the order of Pod creation or deletion. | Ensures ordered creation, deletion, and scaling of Pods. | No guarantee of the order of Pod creation or deletion. |
| Rolling Updates  | Not supported.                             | Supports rolling updates with configurable update strategies. | Supports rolling updates with customizable update strategies. | Supports rolling updates with ordered Pod creation and deletion. | Supports rolling updates with node-by-node updates. |
