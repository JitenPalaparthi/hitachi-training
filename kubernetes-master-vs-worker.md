| Feature           | Master Node                                        | Worker Node                                        |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Role              | Responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster, including scheduling, scaling, and managing cluster resources. | Executes tasks assigned by the master node, such as running containers, serving application traffic, and managing storage. |
| Components        | Runs the Kubernetes control plane components, including kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, and etcd. | Does not run control plane components but typically runs kubelet, kube-proxy, and container runtime (e.g., Docker). |
| High Availability| Can be deployed in a high availability configuration for redundancy and fault tolerance. | Can also be deployed in a high availability configuration for redundancy and fault tolerance. |
| Scalability       | Typically runs a single instance of each control plane component, although multiple master nodes can be deployed for high availability. | Can be scaled horizontally by adding or removing worker nodes based on the workload requirements. |
| Resource Allocation| Typically requires more resources compared to worker nodes due to running control plane components. | Requires fewer resources compared to master nodes as it primarily executes workload tasks. |
| Security          | Access to the master node is restricted to authorized users/administrators for security reasons. | Worker nodes require access to the Kubernetes API server for communication with the master node. Security measures, such as RBAC and network policies, are implemented to secure communication. |
| Failure Handling  | Master node failures can impact cluster operations; therefore, high availability configurations are recommended. | Worker node failures are less critical and can be handled by rescheduling Pods to other available nodes. |
| Workload Execution| Does not typically execute user workloads directly but coordinates the scheduling and execution of workloads on worker nodes. | Executes user workloads, such as containers, Pods, and applications, assigned by the master node. |
| Monitoring        | Monitors the overall health and performance of the cluster, including control plane components and cluster-wide metrics. | Monitors the health and performance of individual nodes, including resource usage, container health, and node conditions. |
